        <h3 style="color: #00a4cc;"> What is RaiderTrade?</h3>
        <p class="subHead">RaiderTrade is a for profit company which has yet to make any profits. We aim to sell items that college kids would buy and at a price that college students can afford</p>
        <h3 style="color: #00a4cc;"> How we got our start</h3>
        <p class="subHead"> RaiderTrade got their start back in 2016 in a dorm room and since then we have grown to 2 dorm rooms. 
            They have plans to expand into maybe a third dorm room by next fall, but are waiting to see how the fiscal year turns out</p>
        <h3 style="color: #00a4cc;">Why buy from us?</h3>
        <p class="subHead">You should buy from RaiderTrade because we are selling the products that college kids need. Our niche consumer group allows us to cater to their practical needs. 
            Our prices are low and our items are purchased from only the best thrift stores.</p>
